# Binary Search Tree

## Operations

- Searching
  - Recursive Search
  - Iterative Search
  - Successor
  - Predecessor
  - Min
  - Max
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Depth First Traversal (use stack - implicit for recursion / explicit for iteration)
  - In-Order (Left - Root - Right)
    - Sorted Result
  - Pre-Order (Root - Left - Right)
    - Inspect Root before any child
  - Post-Order (Left - Right - Root)
    - Inspect children before parent
    - Delete the entire tree
- Breadth First Traversal (use a queue)

## Types of Binary Search Tree

- Unbalanced Tree
- Height Balanced Trees
  - AVL Tree
  - Red-Black Tree
- Weight Balanced Trees

## Applications

- Sort
- Priority Queue
